## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the canada-pandemic starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the canada-pandemic starter
    gatsby new my-pandemic-coverage https://github.com/masoudkarimif/gatsby-starter-canada-pandemic
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-pandemic-coverage/
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!


    Open the `my-pandemic-coverage` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `gatsby-config.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Customizing `gatsby-config.js`

All you need to do for customizing this template is to edit this file.

1. **General information**

   ```shell
   siteUrl: `https://gatsby-starter-canada-pandemic.netlify.com/`,
   name: `The Local News`,
   description: `Tracking The Spread of Coronavirus in Canada`,
   last_updated: `Mar 30, 2020 - 9:45 a.m. ET`,
   ```

   Here you will enter the general information about your website.

2) **Data**

   ```shell
   data: [
         {"province": "Alberta", "cases": 661, "deaths": 3},
         {"province": "Saskatchewan", "cases": 156, "deaths": 0},
         {"province": "Manitoba", "cases": 72, "deaths": 1},
         {"province": "Newfoundland", "cases": 135, "deaths": 1},
         {"province": "Prince Edward Island", "cases": 11, "deaths": 0},
         {"province": "Nova Scotia", "cases": 122, "deaths": 0},
         {"province": "Northwest Territories", "cases": 1, "deaths": 0},
         {"province": "Nunavut", "cases": 0, "deaths": 0},
         {"province": "Ontario", "cases": 1355, "deaths": 23},
         {"province": "New Brunswick", "cases": 66, "deaths": 0},
         {"province": "Yukon", "cases": 4, "deaths": 0},
         {"province": "British Columbia", "cases": 884, "deaths": 17},
         {"province": "Quebec", "cases": 2840, "deaths": 22},
       ],
   ```

   This is where you put the information about cases and deaths for each province. Please note that the order of the provinces is important.

3. **FAQs**

   ```shell
       faqs: [
         {"question": `What is a Coronavirus?`, "answer": `<p>Answer</p>`},
         ]
   ```

   Here you will put your frequently asked questions. As you can see, you can use HTML tags to further customize your question and answers. There's no limit with regard to the number of questions.

4) **Google Analytics**

   ```shell
   plugins: [
       {
         resolve: `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`,
         options: {
           trackingId: "UA-111111111-1",
           head: true,
         },
       },
     ],
   ```

   Add your Google Analytics tracking id here.
